# Welcome to the ISLP Laboratory Project about Machine Learning Algorithms!

This repository contains the data and code from the textbook "Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Gareth James, Daniela Witten, and Jonathan Taylor. The project reorganizes the code into datasets, summarizes the theory, and provides expanded explanations for both the theory in German and the code. It also includes some rewritten code and clearer variable names.

## Overview
This project is a personal endeavor to better understand the material in the "Introduction to Statistical Learning" textbook. It includes:
- Reorganized code for each dataset.
- Summarized theory with additional explanations.
- Modified code with clearer variable names.
- Jupyter Notebooks in English.
- Markdown files in both German.
